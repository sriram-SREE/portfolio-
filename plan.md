# Mount Fuji-Inspired Vegetarian Fine-Dining Restaurant Website Plan

## Notes
- Prioritize minimalist Japanese design aesthetics, inspired by Mount Fuji.
- Responsive, mobile-first, single-page layout.
- Cinematic, immersive scrolling with seasonal transformations (background, images, typography, ambient effects).
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for animations.
- AI-powered image generation for each section; user may provide images if desired.
- Color palette: Fuji Blue (#6DAEDB), Yuzu Gold (#FFC857), Mist Grey (#E0E4E8).
- Typography: Zen Maru Gothic; maintain high-contrast readability.
- Interactive elements: custom cursor, scroll-triggered animations, parallax, glassmorphic UI, hover effects.
- Accessibility: high color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alt text for all images.
- Performance: lazy load images, minimize dependencies, efficient CSS animations.
- Deployment-ready for GitHub Pages, with README and semantic versioning.
- User will provide images if not satisfied with generated hero section image.
- Only one hero image (fuji1.jpg) is currently present; carousel temporarily disabled until more images are provided. Add more images to re-enable carousel functionality.
- User requested a gallery section and images for dishes in the menu.
- User provided five seasonal restaurant images for the gallery, each representing a different season and showcasing the restaurant's transformation for guests to enjoy Mount Fuji year-round.
- User's environment does not have Python or Node.js installed; cannot run local servers via common commands.
- Must provide a solution that works when opening HTML file directly in browser, or guide user to install required tools.

## Task List
- [x] Analyze requirements and define core sections of the website
- [x] Set up project structure with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- [x] Implement seasonal transformation logic (auto-detect date, manual toggle)
- [x] Design and build the hero section (with AI image generation prompt)
- [x] Present hero section image to user for feedback or image substitution
- [x] Implement hero section image carousel with user-provided images
- [x] Add gallery section featuring five user-provided seasonal images, each representing a season and the restaurant's transformation
- [x] Add dish images to menu section (seasonal, visually immersive)
- [ ] Continue building remaining sections (booking, about, etc.) with seasonal and interactive elements
- [ ] Implement advanced interaction layers (ambient sound, cursor effects, scroll-reveal, sticky nav)
- [ ] Optimize for performance and accessibility
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (README, GitHub Pages config, semantic versioning)

## Current Goal
Continue building remaining sections and advanced interactions
